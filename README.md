# Pico Register
Micropython library that provides a convenient and efficient way to interact
with registers and manipulate individual bits of devices connected to the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI).

Access and control the values of registers, perform read and write operations, and manipulate specific bits within a register.

The library abstracts the low-level details of SPI communication, allowing users to focus on working with registers and bits.

## Key Features:
- Simple and intuitive API
- Read and write operations on registers
- Bit-level manipulation and access within registers
